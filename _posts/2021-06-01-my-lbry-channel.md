I have decided to start uploading videos to LBRY / Odysee. Odysee is a video sharing platform simmilar to YouTube that
runs on the LBRY protocol. Odysee is quickly becoming the new hub for _(espicially tech, but all forms of)_ video content
on the internet. My first video is an overview of my [CID RECV](https://github.com/joshburnsyxz/cid-recv) project and
how the CID protocol works.
