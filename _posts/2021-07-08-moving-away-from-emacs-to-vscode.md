This is something I've put off for a long time. Moving to VSCode, I've been an emacs user (on-and-off) for over 5 years. I've written thousands of lines
Elisp for various configs, i've used spacemacs, doom emacs, and all the other "premade configs". Last night I was hacking away at my emacs config and realised
that I've spent over a week, attempting implement this extremly specific feature that i'd completly forgotten my reason for doing so. My emacs configuration has
become almost the focus of using emacs, instead of using emacs to write code and being productive. I've seen VSCode, I've used VSCode, but never saw myself leaving
the emacs bubble, but as i've been trying to get a project off the ground, i've been hacking away at emacs to implement features i *might* rather than simply writing code
for the project. 

For that reason, and a bunch of other irrellevant gripes, I've decided to switch to the editor that all the cool kids are using these days. I'm not giving up on emacs
entirely I might try to get something going, but put on the back burner like other pet projects, not my primary focus like its become.
