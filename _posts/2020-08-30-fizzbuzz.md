Fizzbuzz is a very common interview question. The idea of fizzbuzz is to create a simple program that
performs a simplistic mathematical algorithm. Basically it goes like this.

1. __Print Numbers 1 to 100__.
2. __Every number that is divisable by 3 print Fizz__.
3. __Every number that is divisable by 5 print Buzz__.
4. __Every number that is divisable by 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz__.

Whilst simple and seemingly useless on the surface. Fizzbuzz illustrates several
key development points for recruiters. Here is a basic example of fizzbuzz in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    int num;
    for (num = 1; num<=100; num++) {
        if (num % 3 == 0) {
            printf("Fizz\n");
        }

        else if (num % 5 == 0) {
            printf("Buzz\n");
        }

        else if (num % 3 == 0 && num % 5 == 0) {
            printf("FizzBuzz\n");
        }

        else {
            printf("%d\n", num);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
And the output looks like this
