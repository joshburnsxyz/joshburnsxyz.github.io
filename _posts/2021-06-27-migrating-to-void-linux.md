So recently I have made the switch over to Void Linux, a systemd-free distro
that uses the XBPS package manager. I made this switch after my Artix linux 
setup decided to die on me. I have made a video on LBRY explaining the 
situation. I'm hoping to have everything up and running again soon.

Also while putting the video together I noticed that even though Im using the
same PC, monitors, rendering and recording settings, the quality of the recording seems
to have dropped in-between distros, Some tweaking there will also have to be made.
