## What is an EDC?

EDC stands for Everyday Carry, The idea of putting together a kit that you carry, well, every day. 
What goes in this kit is very dependant on what you do, where you're going, and the problems you're likely to encounter.
Theres no hard and fast rules as to what an EDC can consist of, but heres an idea on some general guidelines to keep in mind
when looking for things to fill your pockets.

- Lightweight / Small form factor - Obviously, you don'
- Cheap / Easily replaceable - I don't reccomend an expensive family heirloom as a day-to-day carry
- Local Law - If the carry of something like a blade is something of concern in your area make sure you're compliant


## Some Things to Consider

Some very common items people add to their EDC are things like, a folding knife, a pry bar or multitool, a cigarette lighter
(even if you don't smoke, this can come in handy), pens, flashlights, etc. One thing to keep in mind, is that the EDC hobby (if you can call it that) often
gets mixed with the survivalist / prepper types and for good reason, these guys dedicate their lives to surviving and figuring out
what gear they need to do that. You don't need to go all-out and carry a 36L backpack full of medical supplies and camping gear. Depending
on your situation of course, Your EDC should be aimed at utility. A good principle when putting a kit together is 
_WHIPKIT_.

- __W__ wallet
- __H__ horology (Watch / Something to tell the time)
- __I__ instrument to write with
- __P__ phone
- __K__ keys
- __I__ illumination
- __T__ tool or knife (or both?)

This has sort of become the defacto framework most people use to put their EDC together (at least, initially).

## Example

Keeping with WHIPKIT principle in mind - Here's a quick list of what I tend to carry on my person day-to-day. I live and work in the Technology space 
and as a result have modified my kit as required, This is the kind of the point. It's what you need to get through the day.

In my pockets are - My wallet, phone, and keys. To note my Phone also encompasses covers the "illumination" and "horology" checkpoints. I don't really have a need for a 
second flashlight in my pocket. I also tend to carry a pocket knife as I work in a warehouse where cutting open boxes is a common task throughout the day. A simple Bic pen
(cheap, can buy them in a pack of 20 so if I lose it, so what?) I also have a lighter and a USB stick that has things like my password database and other work related 
documents on it. 

Along side my pocket items I also have a backpack that has my laptop, charger, portable hard-drive, phone charger, and other bits and pieces. Not everything needs to be
pocket sized to count. In my ute I also carry a fully stocked medical kit, some basic survival gear and a jump starter. This is more going into prepper territory than 
EDC but its worth mentioning as at the end of the day its all levels of the same concept.
