This blog post is simply to announce that I am starting
to make videos on the topics I write about, making programming tutorials,
going over linux stuff, etc. My hope is that these videos will suppliment
my in-ability to post consistently. I will cross-post on youtube as-well,
As I hope to be able to do live-streams on there.
