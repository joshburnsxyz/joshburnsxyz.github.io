The C programming language, Terminal based applications, Text editors like Emacs and Vim, Some people might see this stuff
and think of a bygone era, the early days of computing, We have modern applications like Vscode and point-and-click GUIs 
to interact with our applications. Programming languages like Ruby and Javascript don't need a compiler, Why would I complicate
my life using this old tech these days? Well, because it simply works, on multiple levels it *can* be the superior choice. But
overall *old* and *stale* are 2 seperate terms. In this post I want to discuss the difference, and also why some modern software
should be considered deprecated-in-advance by pre-existing things.

## An Example of My Point

__FIXME__
