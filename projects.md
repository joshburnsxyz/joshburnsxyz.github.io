Heres a list of my noteable projects.

## Bantam
A lightweight webserver, aimed at serving static websites, which is to say websites that
don't have a server-side backend. Websites that are purely HTML/CSS don't need the complex
features found in things like Nginx and Apache.

## Jargon Wiki
A free, open-source, lightweight wiki platform, built with minimalism and freedoms in-mind.
Jargon has extremly minimal front-end styling, and a Zero javascript policy to decrease network load
as much as possible and is licensed under the GPLv3 allowing users to modify and use Jargon to fit their
own needs without restriction. My hope is turn this project into a thriving community project.

## Linite
Linite is a web service that allows you to select from a list of software and generate
a custom installation script for linux systems. The origin of the idea came from the
[Ninite](https://ninite.com) program for windows. Linite is essentially (in name and functionality) 
Ninite for linux.

## MiniKV
MiniKV is a small, in-memory, key/value store. Grown from a weekend of writing a redis clone
in ruby as a joke. MiniKV has grown into its own thing, supplying its own useable API library,
type interface, and more.

## Reindent Buffer (Emacs Plugin)
`reindent-buffer.el` is an emacs plugin that provides a simple command to reformat and reindent
the current buffers contents without the need for any extra plugins apart from the relevant major mode.
