Heres a list of my projects.

## Linite
Linite is a web service that allows you to select from a list of software and generate
a custom installation script for linux systems. The origin of the idea came from the
[Ninite](https://ninite.com) program for windows. Linite is essentially (in name and functionality) 
Ninite for linux.

## MiniKV
MiniKV is a small, in-memory, key/value store. Grown from a weekend of writing a redis clone
in ruby as a joke. MiniKV has grown into its own thing, supplying its own useable API library,
type interface, and more.
